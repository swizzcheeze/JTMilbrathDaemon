[ABOUT]

My name is Jeffrey Milbrath (Mil-Brath) and I'm a child of 1980.  I'm based out of SE Wisconsin these days, originally from Chicago IL. Been working with computers since 1986 and I fondly remember IBM's Dr. Watson....I've been waiting for this day a long long time and it is what I envisioned in my Youth.

My main projects right now are AI application building platforms, AI Human-Reasoning Think-Tanks, Augmentation and Enchanced Learning with AI. 



[CURRENT_LOCATION]

Currently home in the SE Wisconsin Area

[MISSION]

Increase AI Awareness, empowering Users to embrace AI to help improve their lives and bring understanding in a world full of Misunderstandings.

[TELOS]

TELOS is my personal framework for tracking purpose and direction in life. It's a structured way to document Problems I want to solve, Missions to address them, Goals to achieve, and Metrics to track progress. The name comes from the Greek word for purpose or end goal.

Problems (P) - The most important issues I see in the world that need solving:
- P1: People lack meaning in their lives, and this is about to get far worse because of AI and robotics taking away most traditional jobs
- P2: People are stuck in a 1950's style hierarchical mindset that makes them think they're not one of the "special ones" with ideas and dreams
- P3: People have poor models for how the world works, and the lack the tools to properly improve them

Missions (M) - My approaches to addressing these problems:
- M1: Increase human Eudaimonia by helping people identify, articulate, and pursue their own purpose in life
- M2: Build systems—heavily leveraging the latest in AI—that help people upgrade to the best possible version of themselves (Human 3.0)
- M3: Transfer (or store) my and B's minds into a format that we can upload into the next (digital) version of our lives
